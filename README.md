**ChatClef is an AI Minecraft copilot mod** that can play the game *for* you or *with* you.  
It builds on top of [Player2](https://player2.game), [AltoClef](https://github.com/MiranCZ/altoclef) and [Baritone](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone), automating Minecraft tasks from start to finish â€” including beating the game completely solo.

## What is ChatClef?

ChatClef is a client-side AI mod designed to be your Minecraft copilot/friend.
If you can open a second client, ChatClef can take over that instance and act as a second AI-controlled player in multiplayer.

To get the AI working you need to have [Player2 app](https://player2.game/) app, install Fabric API and this mod in Minecraft and start Minecraft.
Once installed, the AI will be able to:

- Chat with you
- Complete tasks for you
- Beat the game solo
- Or just mess around with you like a chaotic Minecraft sidekick

Itâ€™s completely free, open-source, and constantly being improved.

## How it works
This mod adds the Player2 interface to [AltoClef](https://github.com/MiranCZ/altoclef) and [Baritone](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone).

The Player2 App provides free STT, TTS and LLM functions. Make sure Player2 APP is running while using this mod.

For AltoClef, take a look at this [Guide from the wiki](https://github.com/MiranCZ/altoclef/wiki/1:-Documentation:-Big-Picture) or this [Video explanation](https://youtu.be/q5OmcinQ2ck?t=387)

## Download

**Note:** After installing, please move/delete your old Baritone configurations if you have any.  
Existing Baritone configs can interfere with ChatClef and introduce bugs (this will be fixed in the future).
