# ChatClef  
*Plays block game.*  
*Built on top of AltoClef and Baritone.*

**ChatClef is an AI-powered Minecraft mod** that can play the game *for* you or *with* you.  
It builds on top of [AltoClef](https://github.com/MiranCZ/altoclef) and [Baritone](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone), automating Minecraft tasks from start to finish â€” including beating the game completely solo.

## What is ChatClef?

ChatClef is a client-side AI mod designed to play Minecraft by itself â€” or act as a second AI-controlled player in multiplayer.  
If you can open a second client, ChatClef can take over that instance using the [Player2 app](https://player2.game/), allowing the AI to:

- Follow you around
- Complete tasks for you
- Beat the game solo
- Or just mess around with you like a chaotic Minecraft sidekick

Itâ€™s completely free, open-source, and constantly being improved.
